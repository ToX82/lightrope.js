## INSTALLATION
* Insert this tag at the end of your website's html code (before the `</body>` tag):

`<script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/lightrope.js/lightrope.js"></script>`
* It's done. Merry Christmas!

## NOTES
The CSS file is automatically loaded, so you don't need to manually insert it in your html code.

Please note that I didn't write the full CSS itself, I've found it somewhere in the web and packaged in an easy to use fashion: just load the js file, and it will inject all the needed HTML and CSS.
